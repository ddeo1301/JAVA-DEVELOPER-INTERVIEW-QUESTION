Object oriented analysis and design(OOAD) in the process of creating software helps us look at and plan a system using ideas about "objects" like parts of the software that represent things in the real world.  
In PPAD, we 1st check out the whole system we need for a certain issue, then find and name the "objects" in that system. After that, we figure out how these objects are connected and make a paln for the whole system

observe the system -> Determine the objects -> Establish relationship between objects -> Model and build the design

WHY OOAD ? 
1) Its extremely easy to understand, which helps in creating models of complex problems
2) Concepts such as inheritance help make the data reusable and scalable
3) Its easily maintainable, which helps identify the issues in the early processes and saves time


Introduction to UML
  - Unified Modeling Language(UML) as a crucial standard for depicting system design. UML, though not a programming Language, aids in representing the behaviourial and structural aspects of a system, thereby assisting software professsionals in various stages of software development. 
  - It also serves as an effective communication tool among all stakeholders involved in a project, ensuring a clear understanding of a software systems inner mechanics

INHERITANCE
  - Child inherits attributes and behaviour from Parent and is a way to create class from existing class
  - The Derived/Child/Sub class inherits some attributes and behaviours from Base/Parent/Super Class, and may have more specialised attributes and behaviours
  - Inheritance is used where objects exhibits a hierarchical relationship, signifying a specialized - generalised connections

TYPES OF INHERITANCE:
  1) Single Inheritance
  2) Multilevel Inheritance
  3) Hierarical Inheritance
  4) Hybrid Inheritance
  5) Multiple Inheritance
  Java doesnot support multiple inheritance


ADVANTAGES :- 
  1) Reusability :- Avoids duplicating methods in child classes that already exist in parent classes
  2) Code modification :- Localises changes, preventing inconsistencies throughout the program.
  3) Extensibility :- Allow easy enhancement or upgrade of specific parts of a product without core attributes
  4) Data hiding :- Supports encapsulation by keeping some data private in the base class, preventing alteration by derived classes

DRAWBACKS OF FUNCTIONAL/PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING
1) Doesnot model real world problem
2) If new data is added, all the functions needs to be modified to acccess the Data
3) Global data is accessible to all the functions
4) No clear boundaries and well defination of code
5) No Modularity :- Functional programs can become monolith and difficult to maintain as they grow in complexity


WHAT IS OOPS?
1) programming style, involves dividing a program into pieces of objects in which each objects has its own attributes and behaviours.
2) OOPS PROMOTES MODULARITY by encapsulating data and behaviour within objects. This modular approach enhances code reusablity and maintainability, as object can be reused in different parts of the program


OBJECTS AND CLASSES
1) Real world entities like cars, person, students, building etc., they all have some state and behaviour.
2) For eg:- Student named Rahul, is an real world entity, in programming, he is an object.
      car is class but fortuner is an object
3) what defines, how would an object look like?, there must be blueprint i.e class
4) Hence, Object is an instance of a class


ATTRIBUTES AND BEHAVIOUR / METHODS / FUNCTIONS
1) Attributes are state, properties of an object.  eg:- name:String.....age:Integer.....height:Double
2) Behaviour is method/functions that an object can perform. eg:- speak()....eat()


1) OOPS is a programming paradigm focussed on implementing real-world objects
2) class and object are fundamental building blocks of OOPS concept
3) attributes and behaviour we encapsulate it in a container and that we call a class

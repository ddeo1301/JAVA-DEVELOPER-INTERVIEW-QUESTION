Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to send a command without knowing which object will handle the request. This pattern creates a chain of receiver objects for a request. When a request comes in, it is passed along the chain until an object handles it or the end of the chain is reached.

KEY CONCEPTS
   - Handler Interface: Defines an interface for handling requests. It typically includes a method to set the next handler in the chain and a method to process the request.
   - Concrete Handlers: Implement the handler interface and process the request if they are responsible for it. If not, they pass the request to the next handler in the chain.
   - Client: Initiates the request and specifies the first handler in the chain.

EXAMPLE SCENARIO
   - Imagine a scenario where we have a support system that processes various types of support requests. The requests could be handled by different levels of support: front-line support, supervisor, and manager.

            // Handler interface
            abstract class Handler {
                protected Handler nextHandler;

                public void setNextHandler(Handler nextHandler) {
                    this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
                }

                public abstract String handleRequest(String request);
            }
            // Handler Interface: The Handler abstract class defines the interface with the setNextHandler method to set the next handler and the handleRequest method to process the request.


            // Concrete Handler: Frontline Support
            class FrontlineSupport extends Handler {
                @Override
                public String handleRequest(String request) {
                    if (request.equals("basic issue")) {
                        return "Frontline support handled the " + request + ".";
                    } else if (nextHandler != null) {
                        return nextHandler.handleRequest(request);
                    } else {
                        return "No handler could process the request.";
                    }
                }
            }

            // Concrete Handler: Supervisor
            class Supervisor extends Handler {
                @Override
                public String handleRequest(String request) {
                    if (request.equals("intermediate issue")) {
                        return "Supervisor handled the " + request + ".";
                    } else if (nextHandler != null) {
                        return nextHandler.handleRequest(request);
                    } else {
                        return "No handler could process the request.";
                    }
                }
            }

            // Concrete Handler: Manager
            class Manager extends Handler {
                @Override
                public String handleRequest(String request) {
                    if (request.equals("complex issue")) {
                        return "Manager handled the " + request + ".";
                    } else if (nextHandler != null) {
                        return nextHandler.handleRequest(request);
                    } else {
                        return "No handler could process the request.";
                    }
                }
            }
            // Concrete Handlers: FrontlineSupport, Supervisor, and Manager classes extend Handler and implement the handleRequest method. Each handler checks if it can process the request; if not, it passes the request to the next handler.



            public class Client {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    // Create the handlers
                    Handler frontlineSupport = new FrontlineSupport();
                    Handler supervisor = new Supervisor();
                    Handler manager = new Manager();

                    // Create the chain
                    frontlineSupport.setNextHandler(supervisor);
                    supervisor.setNextHandler(manager);

                    // Client sends requests to the chain
                    String[] requests = {"basic issue", "intermediate issue", "complex issue", "unknown issue"};

                    for (String request : requests) {
                        System.out.println("Request: " + request + " => " + frontlineSupport.handleRequest(request));
                    }
                }
            }
            // Client: The client code sets up the chain of handlers and sends various requests to the first handler in the chain. Each request is processed by the appropriate handler or results in a message indicating no handler could process it.




BENEFITS
   - Decoupling: The sender of a request is decoupled from the receiver.
   - Responsibility Sharing: Multiple objects can handle a request, allowing for more flexible and distributed handling of requests.
   - Dynamic Chains: Handlers can be added or changed at runtime.

DRAWBACKS
   - Uncertain Handling: There's no guarantee that a request will be handled if the chain is not properly configured.
   - Performance: Passing requests along a long chain can affect performance.

   -  Chain of Responsibility pattern demonstrates how you can create a flexible and maintainable support system where different levels of support handle various types of requests.
